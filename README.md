# Bikeways for Everybody
Crowd-sourcing lines on a map to solicit public input on ideal locations for fully protected bike routes as part of the [Boston Cyclists' Union's Bikeways for Everybody initiative](http://bostoncyclistsunion.org/bikeways-for-everybody/). See the live site [here](https://boston-cyclists-union.github.io/bikeways4everybody/)

## Inspirations:  
 * Sarah Bindman's app to [map bikeroutes](https://github.com/sbindman/Veloroute) (Great for the "snapping of lines to streets"--actually directions from MapBox. Currently with reduced functionality due to restricted APIs). 
 * Code for Philly with the Philadelphia Bike coalition developed an [app to log people's routes](http://cyclephilly.org/) and produced this [web-map](http://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/cyclephilly/)
 * Mike Foster's [work](https://github.com/mjfoster83/neighborhoods) on crowdsourcing neighbourhoods
 * BostonGIS [tutorial](http://www.bostongis.com/PrinterFriendly.aspx?content_name=using_custom_osm_tiles) For clipping osm tiles to a polygon
